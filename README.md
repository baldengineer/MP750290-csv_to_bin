# MP750290-csv_to_bin

Python script to convert CSV files with waveform data into the binary file format for arbitrary waveform generators.

Tested with Multicomp Pro MP750290 160 MHz / 1.25 Ga/s arb. Should work with other similar models.

CSV file expects voltage points to be a string in volts.

Script does not use command line arguments, edit the file for the file names.

The sine.csv file is an example input.
The sine.bin file is an example output.
